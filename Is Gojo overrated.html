    <h1>Why Is Gojo Satoru Known as Overrated?</h1>
    <p>Gojo Satoru’s “overrated” label really comes down to how different fans perceive power, storytelling, and character depth. Here are the main reasons people bring it up—and why whether it’s “true” depends a lot on personal taste:</p>

    <h2>1. Almost Unbeatable Power</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Infinity &amp; Limitless Techniques</strong>: Gojo’s signature abilities (Infinity barrier, Hollow Purple, Domain Expansion: Unlimited Void) make him effectively untouchable for most opponents. To some fans, this strains suspense—if one character can’t realistically be defeated, battles can feel predictable.</li>
        <li><strong>Screen Time Dominance</strong>: He often arrives to single‑handedly turn the tide, which can overshadow other characters and their development.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Fan Hype &amp; Memes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>“Six Eyes” Craze</strong>: Gojo’s fan following is massive—he’s plastered across fan art, cosplay, memes, even merch. High visibility can feed a “bandwagon” effect: the more people praise him, the more others feel compelled to, too.</li>
        <li><strong>Meme Culture</strong>: Jokes like “Gojo vs. everyone” or “did Gojo even try?” exaggerate his dominance for laughs, but can accidentally reinforce the sense that he’s overhyped.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Storytelling Impact</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Plot Shield</strong>: Whenever stakes grow dire, fans expect Gojo to show up. This safety net can undercut tension—viewers worry less about protagonists if the “strongest sorcerer” is just an Exclamation Mark away.</li>
        <li><strong>Limited Vulnerability</strong>: While Gojo does have weak points (emotional trauma around his best friend, limits in sustained fights, sealed away in the Shibuya Incident arc), these moments are relatively rare. That scarcity fuels the “overrated” complaint.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Character Depth vs. Power Fantasy</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Shallow Side?</strong> Critics say Gojo sometimes skates by on charisma and swagger, without the “flaws” or growth arcs that make other characters resonate emotionally.</li>
        <li><strong>Supporters’ View</strong>: His backstory (loss of his mentor, conflict over the sorcerer hierarchy, bond with Geto) does add depth—many fans feel we’ve only scratched the surface of his motivations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1 class="yes-no">So, is he truly overrated?</h1>
    <p><span class="yes-no">Yes</span>, if you value balanced power scaling, sustained narrative tension, or prefer heroes with more obvious vulnerabilities and slow‑burn growth arcs. In that camp, Gojo’s near-godlike status can feel like a cheat code.</p>
    <p><span class="yes-no">No</span>, if you love charismatic power‑fantasy characters who smash through challenges with style, and you’re fine with occasional “narrative conveniences” so long as they’re entertaining. Gojo’s wit, confidence, and glimpses of genuine emotion keep many fans invested.</p>

    <p>Ultimately, “overrated” is a subjective label. Gojo Satoru is well‑written enough that he lands atop most “favorite characters” lists—but if you start from a different set of priorities (tension, vulnerability, ensemble focus), his dominance might grate. There’s no definitive “true” or “false” here—just what you, personally, enjoy in a story.</p>
