    <h1>Ben Stokes Overthrow Incident - 2019 ICC World Cup Final</h1>

    <h2>1. The Scenario</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Date &amp; Venue:</strong> July 14, 2019, Lord’s Cricket Ground, London.</li>
        <li><strong>Match Situation:</strong> England chasing 242 to win. In the final over, England was nine down needing 15 runs, with Ben Stokes on strike.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. The Overthrow Incident</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Boult’s Delivery &amp; Stokes’s Dive:</strong> Trent Boult bowled a length ball. Stokes slog-swept and dived to make his crease; the throw from deep mid-wicket deflected off his bat and ran to the boundary.</li>
        <li><strong>Runs Awarded:</strong> Two completed runs plus four overthrows, totaling six runs.</li>
        <li><strong>Instant Reaction:</strong> Stokes immediately apologized, asking the umpires to rescind the boundary, acknowledging it was unintended.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Laws of Cricket &amp; Umpires’ Call</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Law 19.8 (Overthrows):</strong> Any overthrow to the boundary scores as boundary runs; once awarded, they stand.</li>
        <li><strong>Umpires:</strong> Christopher Gaffaney and Marais Erasmus applied the law correctly, and the six runs remained.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Post-Match Confirmation</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ben Stokes’s Own Words:</strong> Stokes stated in interviews that the deflection was accidental and he was "fairly shocked" by the boundary.</li>
        <li><strong>James Anderson’s Account:</strong> On the BBC Tailenders podcast, Anderson recounted Stokes pleading, “Can you take those four runs off? We don’t want them.”</li>
        <li><strong>Match Referee’s Statement:</strong> Jeff Crowe confirmed there was no suspicion of foul play.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Impact &amp; Legacy</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Tie &amp; Super Over:</strong> The match and Super Over were tied; England won on boundary count (later abolished by the ICC).</li>
        <li><strong>Rule Change:</strong> ICC removed the boundary countback rule for future finals.</li>
        <li><strong>Stokes’s Legacy:</strong> His apology and sportsmanship became a defining moment of the final.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The overthrow was an accidental, split-second incident. Stokes’s immediate apology underscores his sportsmanship. Legally, the runs stood per the Laws of Cricket, contributing to one of the most dramatic finishes in World Cup history.</p>
